# 3D List Test Zone

An interactive 2.5D Unity-style visualization built with Phaser 3. This project is a showcase of a prefab-style system you created to display items in dynamic containers—such as spinning wheels, vertical bars, and spherical arrays—ideal for casino UIs, bubble menus, or character selection trays.

This work demonstrates your ability to prototype flexible UI container mechanics in JavaScript, leveraging Phaser’s rendering and depth capabilities.

## Purpose

Designed as a technical PoC demonstrating reusable container patterns for interactive item displays. The intent is to build a modular “wheel/bar/sphere” system that can be easily plugged into games or UI frameworks. This replaces and modernizes older ad‑style components, focusing on clean scene logic and flexible item layouts.

## Features

- **Wheel**: Circular sorting of items with rotation animation
- **Bar**: Linear list display with scroll/swipe support
- **Sphere**: 3D-like bubble layout of selectable items
- Configurable item count, spacing, and angle
- Tween-based animations and easing controls
- Basic input handling for item selection and rotation
- Clean modular structure for reuse in different contexts

## Portfolio Relevance

- Demonstrates understanding of 2.5D UI mechanics using Phaser 3
- Highlights modular JavaScript architecture using prefabs-like patterns
- Shows ability to build components for diverse use cases (spin wheels, lists, bubble selectors)
- Uses clean code with minimal external dependencies
- Integrates with GitHub Pages deployment
